// MODEL STRUCTURE:
// All models should be declared with the same structure. Separate each of the following sections with an empty line::
// Section 1: Resource management fields, such as id and createdAt.
// Section 2: Model-specific fields. Declare single-field foreign keys, indexes and constraints on these lines.
// Section 3: Multi-field indexes and constraints that can't be declared on a single line with a specific field.
// Section 4: Inverse relations, as required by prisma schema syntax. These differ from the relations in section 2 as they are not true foreign keys in the raw data structure.

// RELATIONSHIPS:
// All relations must be clearly named. Names should reference the true data structure as well as the semantic purpose.
// Naming conventions should start with the name of the model containing the foreign key, followed by an underscore, followed by the purpose of the relation.
// For example, a relation between a User and a Project would be named "ProjectUser_member".
